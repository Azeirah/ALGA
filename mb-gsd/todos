High-level goals to get a decent grade

[x] Generate graph
    [x] Implement depth-first search
    [x] Make the graph copyable
    [x] Cut a preset number of edges from the graph, leave an edge alone if it's a bridge.
        dfs can be used to determine whether an edge is a bridge or not
[ ] Implement grenade requirement
    [ ] Implement Minimum-spanning tree (prim or kruskal) (using visitor pattern)
    [ ] Add start and end to graph
[ ] Implement Breadth-first search (using visitor pattern)
[ ] Implement Dijkstra's (using visitor pattern)
[ ] Decorate map to look like a game
